Need to write more formal description later.

For now, please note that we did not write the following libraries and that if you would like to access them please clone them from the original repository. They are simply kept here for ease of use and portability.

 - Adafruit_MotorShield.cpp
 - Adafruit_MotorShield.h
 - Adafruit_MS_PWMServo_Driver.cpp
 - Adafruit_MS_PWMServo_Driver.h
 - helper_3dmath.h
 - I2Cdev.cpp
 - I2Cdev.h
 - MPU6050_6axis_MotionApps20.h
 - MPU6050.cpp
 - MPU6050.h
 - Servo.cpp
 - Servo.h
 - ServoTimers.h
 - ArduinoTrace.h

 We did however write the following libraries.
 - IMU.cpp
 - IMU.h
 - IMU_Wrapper.cpp
 - IMU_Wrapper.h
 - Servo_Wrapper.cpp
 - Servo_Wrapper.h
